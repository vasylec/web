        I saw you dancing in a crowded room, uh
        You look so happy when I'm not with you
        But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
        A single teardrop falling from your eye

        I don't know why I run away
        I'll make you cry when I run away

        You could've asked me why I broke your heart
        You could've told me that you fell apart
        But you walked past me like I wasn't there
        And just pretended like you didn't care

        I don't know why I run away
        I'll make you cry when I run away

        Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
        Save your tears for another

        Save your tears for another day
        Save your tears for another day

        So
        I made you think that I would always stay
        I said some things that I should never say
        Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
        And now you won't love me for a second time

        I don't know why I run away
        Oh, girl
        Said, I'll make you cry when I run away

        Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
        Save your tears for another (uh)
        I realize that I'm much too late
        And you deserve someone better

        Save your tears for another day (oh, yeah)
        Save your tears for another day (yeah)

        I don't know why I run away
        I'll make you cry when I run away

        Save your tears for another day
        Ooh, girl, I said (ah)
        Save your tears for another day (ah)

        Save your tears for another day (ah)
        Save your tears for another day (ah)
